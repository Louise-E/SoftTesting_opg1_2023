###What was positive and good about using TDD?
####- What was annoying or difficult?

I found it difficult at first to work with TDD, as I am not used to thinking in reverse. I had to get used to the red-green-refactor cycle.
 
####- What surprised you?

How difficult it would be to get used to working with TDD in the beginning. 

####- Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?

It helped me write some extra test to make sure that the code was working as intended. For example checking that 9 would be converted to IX, and not VIIII.
